# Pacman-game-for-dummies
My implementation of Pacman game in C++ (a simplest version for console application). Available for Unix and Windows.

Version 1.0 - Base game without ghosts, fruits and pellet. Just the maze, pacman and dots.

Version 2.0 - Game with ghosts, fruits and pellet. Pacman has new fields like score and invulnerability.

Version 3.0 - Colored maze, scoreboard and direct input.

$ make (or copy and paste on shell the makefile line)

$ ./pacman

Have fun!
